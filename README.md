# Next JS Redirect App

This simple Next JS application is designed to quickly redirect traffic to another URL. It's perfect for GPTs, Free Beehiiv support, or even just to Rick Roll people. The setup process is straightforward and only requires a few steps to get up and running.

## Getting Started

To use this app for redirecting traffic, follow these steps:

1. **Configure the Redirect URL:**
   - Navigate to the `vercel.json` file in the root directory of this project.
   - Enter the domain you wish to redirect traffic to in the appropriate field.

2. **Deploy the App:**
   - Deploy your app using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), ensuring that it's connected to your project repository.

3. **Set Up the Domain URL:**
   - Go to the Vercel domain settings for your project.
   - Configure the domain URL that you wish people to enter, which will then redirect them to the domain you specified in the `vercel.json` file.

## Example `vercel.json` Configuration

```json
{
  "destination": "https://twitter.com/JeremiahOClark"
}
```
